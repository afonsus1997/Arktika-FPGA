### Power

Need 3.3V and 1.2V

* 3.3V
  * AMS1117
    * Have in stock, but may be too big/overkill
    * Gives some margin for driving more (and more demanding) external peripherals 

* 1.2V
  * MCP1812AT
    * 0.35eur
    * small
    * 300mA max
    * used on the icebreaker fpga and on the kefir fpga



### FPGA

Using the ICE40HX4K-TQ144
